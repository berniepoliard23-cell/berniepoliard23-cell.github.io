                    Now and then, a waitress will spill a drink or the hostess 
                    will trip over the corner of a priceless fur coat, but it's 
                    not every day that a server drops an entire lasagna into a 
                    customer's Louis Vuitton purse. It's those moments that 
                    keep hospitality and customer service employees up at night, 
                    but at least we can all laugh our way to the break room and 
                    be a good sport about it.
                    
                    This bride never considered the 
                    dangers of having tomato soup served by a clumsy caterer, 
                    but alas, we're all human, and humans make mistakes 
                    sometimes. Servers are not immune to awkward moments and 
                    clumsy behavior in the workplace just because they put on a 
                    face of immaculate decorum whenever they start a shift. 
                    Sometimes, caterers experience unhinged, jaw-droppingly 
                    embarrassing moments that will follow them for the rest of 
                    their days. It's just food service after all, isn't it? How 
                    serious could it be?
                    
                    For the customer with dwarfism being mistakenly asked if 
                    they want a kid's menu, perhaps it's very seriousâ€¦ Seriously 
                    funny.
