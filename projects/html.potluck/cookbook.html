        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Pie Crust</h3>
           <ul>
               <li> ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
               <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
               <li>½ cup cold butter or shortening</li>
               <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
           </ul>

        <b>Filling</b>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees 
                    F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a 
                    bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture 
                    resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
                <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is 
                    moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon 
                    water if needed.</li>
                <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll 
                    dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 
                    inch.</li>
                <li>Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp 
                    knife to cut a circle of dough 1 ½ inches larger than the 
                    pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan 
                    aside.</li>
                <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; 
                    transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing 
                    dough into the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
                <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown 
                    sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large 
                    bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into 
                    the prepared crust.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the 
                    filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 
                    minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from 
                    burning as the filling cooks.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before 
                    serving.</li>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz (226 g) pasta penne or rigatoni</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sliced red and yellow bell peppers red and green will 
                work too</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic finely minced</li>
            <li>6 oz (170 g) evaporated milk like Nestle Carnation or homemade
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup (57 g) mayonnaise room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cups (85 g) shredded Gouda cheese plus more for topping, 
                shred your own cheese for best results</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (22 g) grated Parmesan cheese plus more for topping, 
                shred your own cheese for best results</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute the veggies. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over 
                medium heat. Once butter is sizzling, add the onions to the 
                skillet and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the peppers and saute 
                for 3-4 minutes or until tender. You can reduce the heat if 
                the onions are cooking too fast. Finally, add the garlic and 
                saute for another 1-2 minutes or until fragrant. Turn off 
                the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F and grease a baking dish with 
                butter.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta in salted water according to the package 
                instructions. Cook until soft or al dente depending on your 
                preference. The authentic version of this dish features 
                fully cooked pasta but if you don't like soft pasta bakes, 
                cook until al dente. Drain, return the pasta to the hot pot, 
                and immediately move onto the next step.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pasta bake. In the same pot, add the prepared 
                veggies, evaporated milk, mayonnaise, Gouda, and parmesan 
                cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix until the 
                cheese starts to melt then transfer the pasta to the baking 
                dish. Top with extra shredded Gouda and parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cheese has melted and 
                the top is golden. You can also broil the dish for 2-3 
                minutes for a crispy golden brown top. Remove from the oven 
                and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
