           Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus (Marlon Wayans) and Kevin Copeland 
           (Shawn Wayans), accidentally foil a drug bust. As punishment, they 
           are forced to escort a pair of socialites (Anne Dudek, Rochelle Aytes) 
           to the Hamptons, where they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper. 
           But when the girls realize the FBI's plan, they refuse to go. Left 
           without options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose as the sisters, 
           transforming themselves from African-American men into a pair of 
           blonde, white women.
