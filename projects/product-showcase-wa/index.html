                Lunchables was designed in 1985 by Craig Mims[7] as a way for 
                Oscar Mayer to sell more bologna and other lunch meat.[7] After 
                organizing focus groups of American mothers, Drane discovered 
                that their primary concern was time. Working mothers, especially, 
                were pressed by the time constraints of fixing breakfast for 
                their families as well as packing lunch for their children to 
                eat at school.[8] This gave Drane the idea of creating a 
                convenient prepackaged lunch featuring Oscar Mayer's trademark 
                lunch meats. Crackers were substituted for bread because they 
                would last longer in grocery coolers. The cheese was provided 
                by Kraft when Oscar Mayer merged with Kraft in 1988. The design 
                of the package was based on the look of an American TV dinner.[9]
